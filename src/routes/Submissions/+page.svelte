        The English Society of Hansraj College is coming out with the third issue of its Literary Journal – Willow, and invites submissions for the same!
      </p>
      <p class="font-serif font-bold">
        For our third issue of Willow, we embark on an exploration of ‘change’, and the ongoing struggle of adapting to a life where inconstancy remains the only constant. Change is like that thread that shifts colors, but weaves through every single moment in our evolving lives. It shapes us in ways we might never completely understand. But it’s the essence of change itself that keeps our stories going. The journal aspires to provide readers with a cathartic experience, delving into the nuances of change and its catalyzing factors.
